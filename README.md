# Dropbox File Finder 📝  
This app will find a student's task folder automatically and also allow you to download the task folder or open it in Dropbox with one click.

# Installation
~~~bash  
Download & unzip > in Chrome Extensions manager > "Load unpacked".
Do not delete or move the unzipped folder as Chrome will need this to run the extension correctly.
~~~
- **Important!**:
When running the extension for the first time and every 
**4 hours**, you will need to get a new "Dropbox access token". 
The app will let you know when you need to get a new 
token with a popup message. Just click ok. 
You will be redirected to a new page. 
Click the "Allow access" button,  then the "Hyperiondev" 
button. This will get a new token. You will then be 
redirected back to your main CoGrammar 
dashboard when this is done.
